# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Liquor store survival run

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A choose your own adventure game, reannacting the liquor store scene from superbad. I would have it so if you play it right it will take you through the whole scene with alternate endings that correlate with the funny what if sequences from the movie.




## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I think that my software will be a series of if/else statements that are sequencial and will set you down a certian path. I think it will be three main statements that follow each of the characters and then from there it will branch out like two paths diverging for each decision. I am unsure how many rounds there will be. I think that will be more of a function of how well it will go. It will be formatted like videogames_irl which is like where someone gets punched ina video and they lose hp, I think that will add an entertaining element to it. It will just be a word based game. I think incorportating a visual element into it is a it above my paygrade. If you continue to amke the wrong decisions you can lose the game by getting arrested or mugged and that the end goal of the gam ewill be to supply alcoholo to your party. I will convey this in the begining.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be just one storyline involving all three characters as one and you make decisions together. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be having a way to play as each character and it would be fairly long but possibly not being as detailed as I would like.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be being able to play as all three characters and have all the details from the scene in the movie as well as some of my own ideas incorporated into the story.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The skills I will need to acquire will be how to properly format something like this. All of the sequencial if/else statements have been fairly brief and I imagine i am going to run into some porblems when making it longer and having stories overlap and such. I am going to research other choose your own adventure word based games to make sure it feels good inside its genre. I am also going to research how to stay organized when working on larger projects to make sure editing is not too complicated.
